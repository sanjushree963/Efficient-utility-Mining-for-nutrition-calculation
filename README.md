# Efficient-utility-Mining-for-nutrition-calculation
INTRODUCTION
Objective of Project
•	  The main objective of this project is to mine the frequent item set and maximum threshold signature of the Health suggestion.
•	The suggestion will be generated through the food consumed and calorie information.
•	Here EHAUPM - Enhanced Efficient High Average-Utility Pattern Mining for efficient data retrieval.
•	A new concept called data engineering is used in the system to find associations with the calories used and generate some health tips.
•	Rule Mining Concepts like Association rules has been implemented to make the result much better
•	All the result will be shown in chart and graph

Existing System  
The problem of frequent item set mining is prominent. In any case, it has some critical constraints with regards to investigating client exchanges. A vital constraint is that buy amounts are not considered. In this manner, a thing may just show up once or zero time in an exchange. In this manner, if a client has purchased five breads, ten breads or twenty breads, it is seen as the same. 
A moment imperative restriction is that all things are seen as having a similar significance, utility of weight. For instance, if a client purchases an extremely costly container of wine or a modest bit of bread, it is seen as being similarly vital. 
In data mining, frequent pattern mining (FPM) is a standout amongst the most seriously explored issues as far as computational and algorithmic advancement. In the course of the most recent two decades, various calculations have been proposed to tackle visit design mining or some of its variations, and the enthusiasm for this issue still continues. Distinctive systems have been characterized for visit design mining. The most widely recognized one is the help based system, in which item sets with recurrence over a given edge are found. Be that as it may, such item sets may now and then not speak to intriguing positive connections between's things since they don't standardize for the total frequencies of the things. Thusly, elective measures for intriguing quality have been characterized in the writing.      

Disadvantages of Existing system
Frequent pattern mining in K mine is the patterns which appear frequently in database and it takes more time for execution. 
For example a set of items, such as milk and bread, that appear frequently together in a transaction data set is a frequent itemset. A subsequence, such as buying first a PC, then a digital camera, and then a memory card, if it occurs frequently in a shopping history database, is a (frequent) sequential pattern. If Pattern occurs frequently, it is called a frequent pattern. Finding such frequent patterns is more difficult in the existing system
Frequent pattern mining has become an existing data mining task and it only focused theme in data mining research so there is no wide range of analysis is available. A typical example of frequent item set mining is market basket analysis. 
This process analyzes customer buying habits by finding associations between the different items that customers place in their “shopping baskets”. 
The discovery of such associations cannot help retailers to develop marketing strategies by gaining insight into which items are frequently purchased together by customers.

Proposed System
K – Mining is introducing in Data mining as an important part of knowledge discovery process that we can analyze an enormous set of data and get hidden and useful knowledge. Data mining is applied effectively not only in the business environment but also in other fields such as weather forecast, medicine, transportation, healthcare, insurance, government…etc. 
Here the data engineering has been applied for health prediction through food consumed. Data mining has a lot of advantages when using in a specific industry. Besides those advantages, data mining also has its own disadvantages e.g., privacy, security and misuse of information. We will examine those advantages and disadvantages of data mining in different industries in a greater detail.
Here Data mining used for the process of selecting, exploring and modelling large amounts of food data. This process has become an increasingly pervasive activity in all areas of medical science research. Data mining has resulted in the discovery of useful hidden patterns from massive databases. Data mining problems are often solved using different approaches from both computer sciences, such as multi-dimensional databases, machine learning, soft computing and data visualization; and statistics, including hypothesis testing, clustering, classification, and regression techniques.
The mining model that an algorithm creates from your data can take various forms, including:
•	A set of clusters that describe how the cases in a dataset are related.
•	A decision tree that predicts an outcome, and describes how different criteria affect that outcome.
•	A set of rules that describe how products are grouped together in a transaction, and the probabilities that products are purchased together.
